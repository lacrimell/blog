## Working days

I had a pleasent conversation with my friend on the phone on Sunday evening, which helped to start week off onn a positive note.

When I was a child, I listened to the Ramones. I hadn't listened to them since then until this week. Their music happened to be recommended to me and I fell in love with it again.

I have extended my eyelashes to match the color of my hair and I am very pleased with the result (my eyelashes are now blue).

## My birthday

My sweet friend Nastya called me as soon as my birthday arrived and wished me a happy birthday! She drew me a lovely card. All my friends sent me birthday wishes, and Katyusha even came over to my house with a cake in the evening. I got dressed up in some nice clothes, put on some beautiful makeup, and then we all went out to the local cosmetics store after lessons.
